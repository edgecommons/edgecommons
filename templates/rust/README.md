# <<COMPONENTNAME>>

An AWS IoT Greengrass v2 component (`<<COMPONENTFULLNAME>>`) written in Rust on top
of the `ggcommons` Rust library, generated from the GGCommons Rust component template
by the `ggcommons` CLI. It gives you the library's
standard CLI contract, configuration, logging, messaging, metrics, and heartbeat —
so you write only business logic in [`src/app.rs`](src/app.rs).

## Project layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/main.rs` | Entry point: builds the `ggcommons` runtime from CLI args, runs the app. |
| `src/app.rs` | Your component logic (starts as a minimal app + config-change listener). |
| `Cargo.toml` | Crate manifest. Depends on the `ggcommons` library (path dependency). |
| `recipe.yaml` | Greengrass component recipe (default config + IPC access control). |
| `gdk-config.json` | Greengrass Development Kit config (`build_system: custom` → `build.sh`). |
| `build.sh` | Builds the release binary (with the `greengrass` feature) and stages it for the GDK. |
| `test-configs/` | Sample `config.json` + `standalone-messaging.json` for local runs. |

## Develop & run locally (HOST platform, MQTT transport)

Local development runs on the HOST platform with the MQTT transport (dual-broker MQTT) — no
Greengrass core or Linux/`libclang` toolchain needed. Start a local MQTT broker, then:

```bash
cargo run -- \
  --platform HOST --transport MQTT ./test-configs/standalone-messaging.json \
  -c FILE ./test-configs/config.json \
  -t my-thing
```

## CLI contract

- `-c/--config <SOURCE> [args...]` — `FILE | ENV | GG_CONFIG | SHADOW | CONFIG_COMPONENT` (default: from the resolved platform profile — GREENGRASS → GG_CONFIG, HOST → FILE, KUBERNETES → CONFIGMAP)
- `--platform <PLATFORM>` — `GREENGRASS | HOST | KUBERNETES | auto` (default `auto`)
- `--transport <TRANSPORT> [path]` — `IPC | MQTT [messaging_config.json]` (default: from the platform; IPC only valid on GREENGRASS)
- `-t/--thing <name>` — IoT Thing name

## Deploy to Greengrass

The on-device build uses the GDK **custom** build system (`gdk-config.json` →
`custom_build_command: bash build.sh`). `build.sh` compiles the binary with the
`greengrass` feature (Greengrass IPC) and stages it per the GDK contract, then
`gdk component publish` uploads the artifact + recipe and registers the component
version in your account.

```bash
gdk component build
gdk component publish
```

> **Linux-only device build:** the `greengrass` feature compiles a C-FFI SDK and
> only builds on Linux (with `libclang`). Build on a Linux host, or cross-compile:
> `GGCOMMONS_TARGET=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu gdk component build`.

## Deploy to Kubernetes

Generated only when KUBERNETES is a selected target. The `Dockerfile` builds the
standalone binary into a slim, non-root image; `k8s/` holds the manifests. With
`--platform auto` the library detects KUBERNETES from the ServiceAccount token, so
no args are needed — config source defaults to CONFIGMAP, transport to MQTT (broker
config from the mounted ConfigMap), identity from the Downward API.

```bash
# 1. Build the image (the cargo git dep needs network + git auth — see Dockerfile).
docker build -t ghcr.io/<owner>/<<COMPONENTNAME>>:latest .

# 2. Make it available to the cluster: push to your registry, or load into a local kind cluster.
docker push ghcr.io/<owner>/<<COMPONENTNAME>>:latest
#   kind load docker-image ghcr.io/<owner>/<<COMPONENTNAME>>:latest

# 3. Set `image:` in k8s/deployment.yaml to that reference (replace REPLACE_ME), then apply.
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

The ConfigMap is mounted as a **directory** at `/etc/ggcommons`; edit `k8s/configmap.yaml`
and `kubectl apply -f k8s/` again to hot-reload the component config in-process (no restart).

## The ggcommons dependency

`Cargo.toml` depends on the `ggcommons` crate via an **absolute path** (filled in at
generation time). When the library is published to a git remote or a cargo registry,
replace that path dependency with the corresponding git/registry dependency.
